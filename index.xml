      <description>This project takes in a data set of songs then sorts them into a queue.
There are several ways to sort and search through data. Within my studies of data structures I have found that there are many methods to get to the same result, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you the programmer to choose which is the most efficient and the fastest to process. This project show uses queues and stacks in order to take in a set of data, specifically in this case Spotify Chart list, the sort it and display the music to play in a queue.</description>

      <title>Manage Your Menu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Menu in the sidebar can be defined within the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; or directly in the files.
I prefer the config file approach, as this menu is pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I found out about Data Science during CUNY&amp;rsquo;s 90 Day Challenge which provided access to a plathora of Coursera courses. It peeked my interest because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on just your computer science skills, but a combination of computer science, statistics and business. It&amp;rsquo;s a field of study which is not really discussed within school, but fortunately Brooklyn College has added Data Science as a minor which I have decided to enlist in to.</description>
